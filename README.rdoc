== MessageFactory

MessageFactory is a simple little library for parsing messages from an IRC
server and generating easy to use objects from them. This library is intended
to be used within an IRC type application, and does nothing of value by itself. 

=== install (easy):

  gem install messagefactory

=== install (less easy):

  git clone http://github.com/spox/messagefactory.git
  cd messagefactory
  gem build *.gemspec
  gem install ./

=== install (less easy that's a little easier)

{rip}[http://hellorip.com/about.html] makes it easy to install directly from a github repository.

=== Testing

MessageFactory is currently tested on:

* Ruby 1.8.6-p383
* Ruby 1.8.7-p248
* Ruby 1.9.1-p376
* JRuby 1.4.0

== Example

=== Code:

  require 'messagefactory'

  factory = MessageFactory::Factory.new
  message = factory.process(':mod_spox!~mod_spox@host JOIN :#m')
  p message

=== Result:

  #<MessageFactory::Message direction=:incoming, received=Fri Feb 05 19:58:42 UTC 2010, raw=":mod_spox!~mod_spox@host JOIN :#m", type=:join, source="mod_spox!~mod_spox@host", channel="#m">
